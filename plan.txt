# Add __repr__ method to Book class for better debug printing

# Add edit_book() method to modify book info (title, author, year)

# Add functions to show stats:
#   - total number of books
#   - the oldest book
#   - the most frequent author

# Learn basics of Python unittest
# Write tests for key functions:
#   - add_book()
#   - remove_books()
#   - search_book()
#   - edit_book() (optional)

# Improve CLI experience:
#   - clear error messages
#   - input validation (e.g., title must not be empty, year must be a number)

# Add new CLI command: "stats" to display book statistics

# Fix problem: remove_books() should update the JSON file after removing the book

# Improve show_books() to display books in a clean numbered list format

# Fix crash on Ctrl+C:
#   - wrap main loop in try/except to catch KeyboardInterrupt
#   - show friendly exit message

# Optional (clean code):
#   - use constants for filenames (e.g., BOOKS_FILE = "books.json")
#   - add docstrings to classes and methods
#   - improve messages shown to user
