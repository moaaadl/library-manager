A clean and simple command-line project to manage your book collection using Python and Object-Oriented Programming.

##  Project Goal

This project is part of my personal journey to master Python by building something small every day.  
The main focus is on learning:

- Python classes and OOP
- File handling with JSON
- CLI apps using `input()`
- Clean code & separation of concerns
